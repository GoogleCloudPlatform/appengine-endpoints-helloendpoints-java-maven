=============================================

A "hello world" application for Google Cloud Endpoints in Java.

## Products
- [App Engine][1]

## Language
- [Java][2]

## APIs
- [Google Cloud Endpoints][3]
- [Google App Engine Maven plugin][4]

## Setup Instructions
1. Update the value of `application` in `appengine-web.xml` to the app ID you
   have registered in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host
   your instance of this sample.
1. Optional step: These sub steps are not required but will enable the "Authenticated
Greeting" functionality.
   1. Update the values in [src/main/java/com/example/helloendpoints/Constants.java](src/main/java/com/example/helloendpoints/Constants.java) to reflect the web client ID you have registered in the
[Credentials on Developers Console for OAuth 2.0 client IDs][6].
    1. Update the value of `google.devrel.samples.helloendpoints.CLIENT_ID` in
[src/main/webapp/js/base.js](src/main/webapp/js/base.js) to reflect the web client ID you have registered in the
[Credentials on Developers Console for OAuth 2.0 client IDs][6].
1. `mvn clean install`
1. Run the application with `mvn appengine:devserver`, and ensure it's running
   by visiting your local server's address (by default [localhost:8080][5].)
1. Get the client library with `mvn appengine:endpoints_get_client_lib` (it will generate a zip file named `helloworld-v1-java.zip` in the root of your project.)
1. Deploy your application to Google App Engine with `mvn appengine:update`
